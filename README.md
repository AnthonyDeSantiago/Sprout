Sprout was coded as part of a semester-long project in SWE4713 Software Application Domain at Kennesaw State University. The purpose of this project was to develop an application in a domain no project member is familiar with, based on documents provided by a domain expert. 

Sprout has a HTML/CSS/JS front-end, using Bootstrap and Vanilla JS, and a Google Firebase back-end. Cloud Firestore is used for our database, and our storage is located in Firebase Storage. User authentication consists of custom username/password tokens hooked into the Firestore email/password auth provider.
